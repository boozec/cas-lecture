\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kubespray takes longer to instantiate new function instances.
    \item K3s and MicroK8s, removing unnecessary components, have reduced the deployment time and complexity, improving performance for the majority of serverless edge workloads. \pause \textbf{\alert{We can say that they are comparable for out serverless performance evaluation.}}
\end{itemize}
